Cloning a project that already exists

Ok, so it's pretty simple. First, get the script ID by opening the script editor up in a web browser and finding it in the URL. Next, create a text file called ".clasp.json" in the directory you want the code to be copied into. Then in that file copy paste this text, replacing the "SCRIPTID" with your actual script id.

{"scriptId":"SCRIPTID"}

Then, with a command line set to that same directory, just type in "clasp pull". All the files from your GAS project will be downloaded into that directory, and whenever you type in "clasp push" the same file will be updated.
