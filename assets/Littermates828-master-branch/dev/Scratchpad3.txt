So each month we have a "horsee" day (literally) and a sober fun day. Would anyone be interested in adding a 'service' day (or the like) where we volunteer for something like "Habitat for Humanity" (https://habitatgsf.org/volunteer/) or the like? In this case shifts are 3-5 hours (purrrrfect) but one has to be over 18 (might be an issue?) - at a minimum it gets us out of the grey rooms for a day and also does some good.

@Jaz - I'm all about re-use - I found this empty box in the freezer and repurposed it as a (albeit small) lunch pail but I just can't pull off these colors (peeps have enough doubts about me as it is). You might be able to do it. Want it? If I ask nicely I might even be able to put some of Jack's pistachio nuts in it and leave it with your holiday tree.

@Ronnie & @Gregg - Under the banner "No More Black Bear", there are 40+ lunch places ($20 and under) that deliver to our work place (not sure if Uber Eats) listed here:

Please bare with me, a Work In Progress as I find the motivation/time/interest.
