// You can store data in local storage using either syntax
localStorage.userName = "rdegges";
localStorage.setItem("favoriteColor", "black");

// Once data is in localStorage, it'll stay there forever until it is
// explicitly removed
alert(localStorage.userName + " really likes the color " + localStorage.favoriteColor + ".");

// Removing data from local storage is also pretty easy. Uncomment the lines
// below to destroy the entries
//localStorage.removeItem("userName");
//localStorage.removeItem("favoriteColor");

This code worked:

function CallClientOM()
{
var context = new SP.ClientContext.get_current();
this.website = context.get_web();
this.currentUser = website.get_currentUser();
context.load(currentUser);
context.executeQueryAsync(Function.createDelegate(this, this.onQuerySucceeded), Function.createDelegate(this, this.onQueryFailed));
}



function onQuerySucceeded(sender, args)
 {
 alert(currentUser.get_loginName());
 }



function onQueryFailed(sender, args)
{
alert('request failed ' + args.get_message() + '\n'+ args.get_stackTrace());
}
